# Meetup Write-Up
#### Text document reflecting on a Tech Meetup I attended, 3-1-18  

## Description

I attended a meetup hosted by Thinkful called "Predict the Oscars Using Data Science". The presentation was made by Mike Swirsky, a data science mentor for Thinkful. The event consisted of a presentation where they described the very basics of the process by which they determined their prediction on the future Oscar winner.

The presentation showed that the used Python to process the data. They also used two different Python packages NumPy and sklearn. Mike proceeded to describe the basics of statistics, such as the fact that it's essentially an educated guess providing a probability in line with correlations, and not a certainty. then, they said that they create decision trees that will lead to accuracy and specificity. The trees are based off questions regarding features of the data set, which is their word for variables or attributes. Using the Oscars data set, they gave an example of features, such as boolean information regarding whether the director of a nominated movie had won before, or if that movie received a BAFTA. The final result delivers probabilities of what nominated movie will win.

Quite a few participants had concerns and questions about models that could be both functional but lead you to making a wrong decision. The result from running your data set would give you probabilities. In the case of a high probability, it doesn't make that movie a certain winner. This was the case with the 2017 Oscars, where Moonlight won although La La Land had over a 50% probability of winning. Moonlight had a 15% chance of winning, and therefore the model functioned correctly, since a movie that had a chance did win, although it was the unlikely one. Participants seemed confused because in business such results could be catastrophic. From this point there was discussion regarding risk-tolerance of companies and how to determine what level of risk could be right for your or your company.

Sadly, I didn't feel like I learned a lot about data science, or even Python from this event. This could be because I have already studied statistics previously and I already had a firm grasp on the basics that they took most of the time covering.

My feedback for this event: I wish that they had covered the programming in more depth. They way that they talked about how the Python packages worked made them seem like black boxes. That seemed to do a disservice to us, since if you don't understand the process your data goes through, you won't understand why you get certain errors or issues with your model.

I wouldn't recommend this specific event in the future, as the information lacked depth. But, as I understand it, Thinkful has 2 events a month where they teach something/provide a social space. I think the other events would probably be more interesting.
